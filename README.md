# conwayCPP
## Conway's Game of Life implemented in C++

#### Introduction
This is this implementation, I attempt an iterative design on Conway. First I'll make it work, and then attempt to make it bigger and better. Let's see where I go.


#### Running Project
- Read config.sh, make sure you get it/its acceptable
- ./config.sh
